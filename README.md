# Bridging the Divide: Global Health and International Development Policy Priorities in the Biden and Trump Eras  

This repository contains the code and analysis for a project examining policy shifts in global health and international development using topic modeling techniques. The project utilizes **BERTopic**, **Structural Topic Modeling (STM)**, and various **preprocessing scripts** to analyze USAID policy documents and track changes in policy focus across different U.S. administrations.  

## Repository Structure  

- **`README.md`** – Overview of the project and repository structure.  
- **`analyses_from_saved.py`** – Script for analyzing previously saved topic models.  
- **`guided_bertopic_modeling.py`** – Implements BERTopic modeling with guided parameters for improved interpretability.  
- **`ocr_revision_for_a_new_csv.py`** – Performs OCR processing and revision to convert policy documents into a structured CSV format.  
- **`wnp2_PowellIII_2025_vandenDool_SWPaper.pdf`** – Final paper detailing the findings and methodology.  

## About the Project  

This research investigates how **USAID’s global health policy priorities** evolved under the Biden and Trump administrations. Using **topic modeling techniques**, the project identifies key themes, policy emphases, and structural differences in policy attention over time. The study provides insights into how political leadership shapes global health strategies and discusses the implications for international development.
