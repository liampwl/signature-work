BRIDGING THE DIVIDE: GLOBAL HEALTH AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY PRIORITIES IN THE BIDEN AND TRUMP ERAS

This repository contains the codebase for a project focused on topic modeling, text preprocessing, and analysis of policy shifts using data from USAID. The project leverages several techniques, including BERTopic modeling, Structural Topic Modeling (STM), and file preprocessing to analyze large datasets and identify meaningful trends. The main goal of this project is to explore shifts in policy attention between different U.S. administrations and how topic modeling can assist in understanding these changes.

The repository is organized into the following sections:

	•	bertopic_modeling/: Contains the code and configurations for performing BERTopic modeling on the USAID dataset.
 
	•	stm_modeling/: Contains the code for performing Structural Topic Modeling (STM) and associated analyses.
 
	•	preprocessing/: Contains scripts for preprocessing datasets, including data cleaning, text tokenization, and format adjustments.
 
	•	data/: Holds sample datasets (if provided) for testing and reproducing the analysis.
